## Description

Introducing Hacker Fit, a React-based web application designed to simplify the search for exercise routines based on specific muscle groups. With the ability to create custom workout routines, users can easily keep track of their fitness goals. We developed this app to streamline the process of discovering new exercises, and to allow users to explore and diversify their fitness routine.

During the development of this app, we expanded our knowledge of Graphql, Apollo client, React Router DOM, JSX, and the Tailwind CSS framework. Additionally, we utilized Node fetch to make API calls, local storage to save user goals,  and JSX to render exercises and definitions to the page.

Overall, Hacker Fit offers an intuitive and effective solution for individuals looking to enhance their fitness routine and stay on track with their goals.
